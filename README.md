INTRODUCTION:

This project is the result of an assignment received during my developer training at IMIE Nantes.

HOW TO USE IT:
- Clone the project
- Open the "index.html" in your favorite web browser
- Once open, click on one of the 6 buttons (+1 hour, -1 hour, +1 minute, -1 minute, +1 second, -1 second) to adjust time
